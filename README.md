## Dashboard Overview
Based on the project objective, I have developed a two-page Power BI dashboard report to analyze and visualize the medicine sales data for 2023. The dashboard is structured as follows:

The Insights Page is dedicated to demographic-based insights. It includes detailed visualizations and analyses of customer demographics, such as age, gender, and customer type (e.g., Frequent Buyer, New Customer). This page helps stakeholders understand the characteristics of their customer base and how different segments contribute to overall sales.
